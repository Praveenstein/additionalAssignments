""" Module for finding the expected number of songs

Problem Statement:
There are N songs in the album. After some song is over the next one is chosen
randomly and independently of what has been played before. Determine the
expected number of songs to listen to until every song is played at least once.

This script requires the following modules be installed in the python environment
    * logging - to perform logging operations

This script contains the following function
    * find_expected_songs - finds the dot product of given two vectors
